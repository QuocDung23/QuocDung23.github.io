    <h1><b>This is <i>still</i> a motherfucking website.</b></h1>
    <span>And it's more fucking perfect than the last guy's</span>
    <h2><b>Seriously, it takes minimal fucking effort to improve this shit.</b></h2>
    <h4><b>7 fucking declarations.</b></h4>
    <span>That's how much CSS it took to turn that <a href="">grotesque pile of shit</a> into this easy-to-read masterpiece. It's so fucking simple and it <i>still</i> has all the glory of the original perfect-ass website:</span>
    <ul>
        <li>Shit's <i>still</i> lightweight and loads fast</li>
        <li><i>still</i> fits on all your shitty screens</li>
        <li><i>still</i> looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
        <li>The motherfucker's <i>still</i> accessible to every asshole that visits your site</li>
        <li>Shit's <i>still</i> legible and gets your fucking point across</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><b>And guess what, motherfucker:</b></h3>
    <span>You never knew it, but it's easy to improve readability on your site. Here's how.</span>
    <h2><b>Let it breathe</b></h2>
    <span>Look at lines 1 and 2 of some shitty website you're building. Assuming they're not married they probably shouldn't be humping. The defaults are trash -- pick a minimum line-height: 1.4 for body copy. Headings should be tighter. If you can't see that...piss off.</span>
    <div>If your text hits the side of the browser, fuck off forever. You ever see a book like that? Yes? What a shitty book.</div>
    <h2><b>A little less contrast</b></h2>
    <div>Black on white? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real life? Tone it down a bit, asshole. I would've even made this site's background a nice #EEEEEE if I wasn't so focused on keeping declarations to a lean 7 fucking lines.</div>
    <h2><b>Size Matters</b></h2>
    <div>I know your partner says otherwise, but it's true. Bump that body copy to render close to 16px or more. Smaller type works well for print, not the screen.</div>
    <h2><b>Line-width, motherfucker</b></h2>
    <div>Looking at an LCD screen is strainful enough. Don't make me read a line of text that's 200 fucking characters long. Keep it to a nice 60-80 and users might actually read more than one sentence of your worthless dribble.</div>
    <h3><b>Yes, this is <i>also</i> fucking satire, you fuck</b></h3>
    <div>I love what the creator of <a href="">this site's inspiration</a> did. What I'm saying is that it's so, so simple to make sites easier to read. Websites are broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible, but they're also fucking ugly. You and all the other web designers out there need to make them not total shit.</div>
